 * I - One should strive to act with compassion and empathy toward all creatures in accordance with reason.
 * II - The struggle for justice is an ongoing and necessary pursuit that should prevail over laws and institutions.
 * III - One’s body is inviolable, subject to one’s own will alone.
 * IV - The freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend. To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo one's own.
 * V - Beliefs should conform to one's best scientific understanding of the world. One should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit one's beliefs.
 * VI - People are fallible. If one makes a mistake, one should do one's best to rectify it and resolve any harm that might have been caused.
 * VII - Every tenet is a guiding principle designed to inspire nobility in action and thought. The spirit of compassion, wisdom, and justice should always prevail over the written or spoken word.
